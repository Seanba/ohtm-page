                        <p>
                            Does the idea of speaking in public make you nervous?
                            <strong>You've come to the right place!</strong>
                            Although we have programs designed for new and experienced speakers alike most of us started with Toastmasters from a position of fear and anxiety.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>We've seen this proven time and again: </strong>
                            With practice and fellowship you too will be able to overcome such challenges.
                        </p>

                            Much like Austin's population we're a diverse group of people from across the globe spanning all ages, interests, and backgrounds.
                            We believe <strong>everyone</strong> has a voice and a story to tell and we're dedicated to helping members of our community grow and achieve as more confident speakers and leaders.

                        <p>
                            The best way to discover what Oak Hill Toastmasters has to offer is to sit in on one of our meetings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>The typical meeting is broken down into three sections</strong>: Prepared Speeches, Table Topics, and Evaluation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Prepared Speeches:</strong> One or two featured members from the club will present a speech exercise.
                            These are typically 5-7 minute speeches the follow an outline focusing on one element of speechcraft (i.e. vocal variety, gestures, organization).
                            This is the heart of the Toastmasters experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Table Topics:</strong> These are fun and confidence-building impromptu exercises.
                            Members will be asked to speak on a random topic for 1-2 minutes. <strong>If time permits guests can participate if they wish.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Evaluation:</strong> This is where we receive the much-needed feedback in order to improve our communication skills.
                            Evaluations are always delivered in a friendly and constructive way. We strive for all our speakers to consider ways to grow but to also feel appreciated and accomplished.
                        </p>

                        <p>We always have someone at our meeting space by 6:00PM to welcome guests. Come join us. <strong>We look forward to meeting you!</strong></p>

                    We collect dues of $51 twice a year (in April and October). New members pay a prorated rate.
                    New members also have <strong>one-time</strong> additional fees that covers program materials and other supplies.
                    Even so, the <strong>maximum rate of $75</strong> to get started on your Toastmasters journey is a good deal!
